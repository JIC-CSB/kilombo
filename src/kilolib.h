/**

 * @mainpage Kilobot Library API
 *
 * This is a version of kilolib.h bundled with the kilobot *simulator*.
 * It defines the same kilobot library API as the native kilolib,
 * with some simulator-specific additions.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The following is the original documentation. 
 *
 * At its core the Kilobot Library library provides the function
 * kilo_init() to initialize the hardware of the kilobots, and the
 * function kilo_start() that uses a basic event loop programming
 * paradigm (this relies on a setup and a loop callback, similar to
 * those used in the arduino software).
 *
 * The API also provides functions to read the various sensors available
 * to the kilobots (get_ambientlight(), get_voltage(), get_temperature()), and
 * also to control the individual pager motors and the RGB led present
 * in each kilobot (set_motors(), set_color()).
 *
 * The user can register callbacks to interact with the messaging
 * subsystem. There are callbacks for the events of message reception
 * (::kilo_message_rx), message transmission (::kilo_message_tx), and
 * notification of successful transmission (::kilo_message_tx_success).
 * By default every kilobot attempts to send message twice per second.
 * Advanced users can modify this through the `kilo_tx_period` variable,
 * although this is discouraged unless you know what you are doing.
 *
 * To prevent collisions the kilobot library uses a basic exponential
 * back-off strategy with carrier sensing. There are no acknowledgement
 * packets, and as such a message is considered to be successfully
 * transmitted when a kilobot is able transmit a message without
 * detecting any contention in the channel.
